*tComment.txt*  tComment -- One comment plugin to rule them all

Author: Thomas Link, samul AT web.de

tComment provides easy to use, file type sensible comments for Vim. It 
can handle embedded syntax.

Some aspects were originally inspired by vimscript #982.


                                                    *tComment-Installation*
Installation~
Copy the file tComment.vim to your plugin directory (~/.vim/plugins/ or 
similar). See |standard-plugin| for further details.

                                                    *tComment-uninstall*
In case you have some bash or similar, you can feed the file 
etc/tComment.lst to rm: >
    
    cd $HOME/.vim/
    rm -i `cat etc/tComment.lst`

                                                    *tComment-Usage*
Usage~
The command TComment is bound to <c-_> by default. TComment works like a 
toggle, i.e., it will comment out text that contains uncommented lines, 
and it will remove comment markup for already commented text.

                                                    *tComment-Key-Bindings*
Key bindings~
    <c-_>        :: :TComment
    <c-_><c-_>   :: :TComment (use this binding to comment text without 
                    the timeout of the above one)
    <c-_><space> :: :TComment <QUERY COMMENT-BEGIN ?COMMENT-END>
    <c-_>b       :: :TCommentBlock
    <c-_>a       :: :TCommentAs <QUERY COMMENT TYPE>
    <c-_>s       :: :TCommentAs <QUERY COMPLETION FOR CURRENT FILE TYPE>

                                                    *tComment-commands*
Alternatively, you can type (? meaning "optional argument"):

                                                    *:TComment*
    :?<range> TComment ?commentBegin ?commentEnd
    :?<range> TComment! ?commentBegin ?commentEnd

                                                    *:TCommentBlock*
    :?<range> TCommentBlock ?commentBegin ?commentEnd
    :?<range> TCommentBlock! ?commentBegin ?commentEnd
    NOTE: This command is kind of crude. It doesn't indent or reformat 
    the text.

                                                    *:TCommentAs*
    :?<range> TCommentAs filetype
    :?<range> TCommentAs! filetype
    NOTE: TCommentAs requires g:tcomment_{filetype} to be defined.

    The bang (!) variants always comment out the selected text and don't 
    work as toggles.

    Using this command you can also use different comment styles by 
    defining g:tcomment_{filetype}_{style}. E.g. block comments are 
    defined by the commentstring in g:tcomment_{filetype}_block. If you 
    want to define, e.g., a fancy block comment style for html you could 
    do something like: >

        let g:tcomment_html_fancy_block = "<!--%s  -->\n  -- "

<   In order to update the list of known comment types without 
    restarting, you also have to: >

        call TCommentCollectFileTypes()

<   This comment style could then be accessed via (this command has 
    command line completion): >

        '<,'>TCommentAs html_fancy_block


Goals~
- Maintain indentation of selected text; the comment markers are left 
  aligned but the text on the right (i.e., the comment) is indented 
  like the original text

- Handle embedded syntax like php+html or html+javaScript+css; you 
  have to set g:tcommentGuessFileType_{&filetype} to 1 or to the 
  fallback file type in order to activate this feature for other file 
  types than php or html
  
  tComment deduces the correct file type from the syntax name, similar 
  to the way EnhancedCommentify.vim does it. In opposition to 
  EnhancedCommentify.vim, it matches the syntax name against a list the 
  known file types, so that it can deal with, e.g., embedded javaScript

- Easy to customize/adapt for an yet unknown syntax by setting buffer 
  local variables (b:commentStart, b:commentEnd, or b:commentstring), 
  global variables (g:tcomment_{&ft} and g:tcomment_{&ft}_block), or the 
  buffer local &commentstring option (which can be set on a vim 
  |modeline|)

- Use 'commentstring' or 'comments' as a fallback (i.e., if a filetype 
  is properly defined, TComment will automatically support it)

- Same short-cut for commenting text and for removing comment markup

- The decision whether text should be commented or uncommented is made 
  on the basis of the whole selection (not line by line); comments in 
  code that should be commented aren't uncommented as it is the case 
  with some other plugins

As of version 0.3, the following file types are explicitly defined:
ada,           apache,        catalog,       cpp,           css,           
c,             docbk,         dosbatch,      dosini,        dsl,           
dylan,         eiffel,        gtkrc,         haskell,       html,          
javaScript,    java,          lisp,          m4,            nroff,         
objc,          ocaml,         pascal,        perl,          php,           
prolog,        ruby,          r,             scheme,        sgml,          
sh,            sql,           spec,          sps,           tcl,           
tex,           tpl,           viki,          vim,           websec,        
xml,           xslt,          yaml,

Brandmeyer's EnhancedCommentify.vim (vimscript #23).
